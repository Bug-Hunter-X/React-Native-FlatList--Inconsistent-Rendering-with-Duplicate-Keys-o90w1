This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and trying to render items with dynamic keys that are not unique.  React Native's `FlatList` relies on keys to efficiently update and recycle list items.  Duplicate keys cause unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering and performance issues. The error may not always be immediately apparent, manifesting as inconsistent UI updates or crashes.
